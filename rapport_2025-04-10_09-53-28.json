However, underlying inflationary pressures likely persisted in categories such as food and core goods. On a monthly basis, the CPI is projected to rise just 0.1%, the smallest increase in eight months, following a 0.2% gain in February. Meanwhile, annual core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy components, is expected to slow to 3.0%, the lowest reading since April 2021, from 3.1% the previous month. In contrast, monthly core CPI is forecast to tick up to 0.3% from 0.2%. Markets will also be watching closely for any early signs of inflationary impact from tariffs already in place since February, including a 10% levy on Chinese imports and increased duties on global steel and aluminum.\n - temps : 71 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Yield Eases as Tariff Relief Calms Markets\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note fell to around 4.28% on Thursday, down from a peak of 4.5% in the previous session, as President Trump announced a pause on many of the new tariffs introduced this week. The move helped ease pressure on Treasuries, which had faced a sharp selloff amid heightened trade tensions. Despite the temporary reprieve, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% in response to Beijing\u2019s retaliatory measures. The EU may also be excluded from the tariff pause, following its announcement of countermeasures against the US. Earlier in the week, Treasury yields had spiked amid reports of foreign selling, reflecting eroding confidence in US fiscal and trade policy stability. Markets are now closely watching the upcoming US inflation data, due Thursday, for further insights into the economic outlook and the Fed\u2019s potential policy response.\n - temps : 224 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Holds Steady After Tariff Relief\n - description : The dollar index held steady around 102.8 on Thursday after a sharp intraday rebound in the previous session, as President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for countries that have not retaliated. The move offered key US trading partners a window for negotiations in a welcome relief amid a dimming economic outlook. Still, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% in response to retaliatory measures from Beijing. The EU, which has announced its own countermeasures, may also be excluded from the tariff pause. While the tariff reprieve provided short-term support for market sentiment, investors remain wary of the broader implications of Trump\u2019s economic policies\u2014particularly their potential impact on growth and inflation. Looking ahead, markets are focused on the latest US inflation figures which could provide further clues about the Fed's policy path and the broader economic trajectory.\n - temps : 328 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Edge Higher on Trump\u2019s 90-Day Tariff Pause\n - description : US stock futures edged higher on Thursday after the major averages posted a historic rally as President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of his new tariffs. In regular trading on Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 jumped 7.87% and 9.52%, respectively, for their biggest one-day gains in five years. The Nasdaq Composite also surged 12.16% for its best single-day performance since 2001. Those gains came as Trump offered a 90-day reprieve on his reciprocal tariffs for countries that have not retaliated. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Megacap technology names led the advance, with notable performances from Nvidia (18.7%), Tesla (22.7%), Apple (15.3%), Meta (14.8%), and Amazon (12%).\n - temps : 474 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : The Dow Jones Index Closes 7.67% Higher\n - description : In New York,  the Dow Jones Index gained 2887 points or 7.67 percent on Wednesday. Gains were led by Nvidia (19.09%), Boeing (15.63%) and Apple (15.21%).\n - temps : 677 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Skyrocket as Trump Announces 90-Day Tariff Pause\n - description : US stocks soared on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of his new tariffs, causing a major market rally. The S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.5%, marking its biggest gain in five years, the Dow Jones rallied 2,960 points, or 7.9%, its biggest gain since 2020, while the Nasdaq jumped 12.1%, its largest one-day jump since 2001. The move extended the consistently-changing economic policy momentum by the administration, and would pause tariffs on key goods suppliers to the US that were initially hit with aggressive taxes like Vietnam and Cambodia. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Tech led the gains after taking the sharpest losses in the month's selloff up to now, with Nvidia soaring 18.7%, Tesla adding 22.7%, and Apple gaining 15.3%, marking its best day since 1998.\n - temps : 710 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Dollar Rebounds After Tariff Relief \n - description : The dollar index trimmed its losses to cross the 103 mark on Wednesday, rebounding from the six-month low of 102 touched on April 3rd after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the sweeping reciprocal tariff package last week for countries that have not retaliated. The move extended the momentum of uncertain economic policy in the US due to constantly changing measures, but triggered an aggressive flux of inflows into US equities as firms with foreign supply chains will not be hit as hard by levies. Still, the President raised tariffs on China to 125% after the latter retaliated against earlier tariffs, while Europe may be left out of the pause as it announced counter measures against the US. While the possibility of lesser tariffs than expected supported the dollar through the week, uncertain economic policy by the new administration kept recession concerns alive by a portion of the market.\n - temps : 794 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : FOMC Minutes Highlight Inflation Concerns Tied to Tariffs\n - description : Fed policymakers expected inflation to be pushed higher this year due to the impact of elevated tariffs, though they acknowledged considerable uncertainty around the magnitude and persistence of these effects, minutes from the last FOMC meeting in March 2025 showed. At the same time, a majority of officials highlighted the possibility that inflationary pressures from various sources could prove more persistent than previously anticipated. Nearly all participants viewed inflation risks as tilted to the upside, while risks to employment were seen as skewed to the downside. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during its March 2025 meeting, extending the pause in its rate-cut cycle that began in January, in line with expectations. The Fed also raised their expectations for inflation for 2025 and 2026 and downgraded their 2025 growth forecasts, while still anticipating reducing interest rates by around 50 bps this year, the same as in the December projection.\n - temps : 798 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Intuitive Surgical Hits 4-week High\n - description : Intuitive Surgical increased to a 4-week high of 520.92 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Intuitive Surgical gained 7.78%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 33.67%.\n - temps : 804 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Treasuries Sell-Off Eases\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note pulled back from its session high to trade around 4.4%, following President Trump\u2019s announcement of a 90-day suspension of higher reciprocal tariffs for dozens of trade partners, effective immediately. At the same time, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 125%, up from 104% previously. Meanwhile, the US Treasury auctioned $39 billion in 10-year notes, with demand seen as robust, offering some relief to the market. Earlier in the session, the benchmark yield had spiked as much as 20bps to 4.5%, reflecting growing investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. Concerns were further stoked by China\u2019s retaliatory move to impose an additional 50% tariff, as well as the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. Reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader shift to cash suggested that investors were liquidating positions, fueling fears that US Treasuries may be losing their traditional safe-haven status.\n - temps : 810 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Surge on Tariff Pause\n - description : US stocks surged on Wednesday, rebounding after testing over one-year lows earlier in the session after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the sweeping tariffs announced last week for the countries that did not retaliate. The S&P 500 surged nearly 8% and the Dow jumped 6.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 outperformed by rising up to 10% on the positive impact that risk-on sentiment has on tech stocks. The move extended the consistently-changing economic policy momentum by the administration, and would pause tariffs on key goods suppliers to the US that were initially hit with aggressive taxes like Vietnam and Cambodia. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Tech led the gains after taking the sharpest losses in the month's selloff up to now, with Nvidia soaring 15%, Tesla adding 16%, and Apple gaining 12%.\n - temps : 818 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Walmart Hits 4-week High\n - description : Walmart increased to a 4-week high of 90.16 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Walmart gained 2.55%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 50.26%.\n - temps : 831 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Treasury Sells Off\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note rose as much as 20bps to 4.5% on Wednesday before easing to 4.4% after a stronger-than-expected auction for 10-year notes offset lower demand by primary dealers earlier this month. Still, the ongoing selloff in bonds reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 883 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Hold Volatile Momentum\n - description : US stocks exchanged gains and blows on Wednesday, extending their volatile momentum and holding the selloff from recent sessions as aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 was volatile around under the 5,000 threshold, while the Dow and the Nasdaq held near over-one-year lows. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on $22 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns of forced liquidation to scramble for cash. Merck, Eli Lilly, and AbbVie fell between 3% and 5% after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceutical inputs. Tech advanced sharply following their underperformance this month.\n - temps : 960 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Crude Oil Inventories Rise More than Expected: EIA\n - description : Crude oil inventories in the US rose by 2.553 million barrels in the week ended April 4, 2025, above market expectations of a 2.2 million build, data from the EIA Petroleum Status Report showed.

The S&P 500 rebounded past 5,000 and the Dow added 100 points, while tech pushed the Nasdaq 100 to gain 1.5%. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on EUR 21 billion of goods.

Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns that investors are forced to liquidate equities to scramble for cash. Tech gained the most with Nvidia adding 3%. Drugmakers led the losses after Trump threatened to raise tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chemicals, with Merck and AbbVie sinking 3%.\n - temps : 1087 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : NextEra Energy Hits 51-week Low\n - description : NextEra Energy decreased to a 51-week low of 63.11 USD.

The increase follows China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs, matching Trump\u2019s initial 34% hike. In response, Trump vowed an additional 50% duty. Including earlier levies from February and March, the total tariff hike on Chinese goods during Trump\u2019s second term reaches 104%. These moves come despite sharp declines in major U.S. indexes and warnings from economists, who caution that the tariffs could drive inflation and disrupt global supply chains. Trump remains defiant, claiming the policy will restore America\u2019s manufacturing base by encouraging companies to return. However, many experts question the feasibility and timeline of such a shift. Beijing has condemned the escalating trade conflict, accusing the U.S. of blackmail and vowing to \u201cfight it to the end.\u201d\n - temps : 1767 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Weakens as Trump Tariffs Take Effect\n - description : The dollar index depreciated past 102.5 on Wednesday, sliding for the second straight session as the implementation of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs weighed on the currency. China faces a cumulative 104% levy amid a full blown trade war with the US, with Beijing vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d to protect its interests. Traders were also disappointed by the lack of concrete developments in trade negotiations even though President Trump spoke with various leaders from major trading partners. Markets are worried that an escalating global trade war could push the US economy into a recession and force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The currency weakened across the board, with the most pronounced selling activity seen against the euro, Australian dollar, and Chinese yuan.\n - temps : 1797 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Drop as Trump Tariffs Kick In\n - description : US stock futures declined Wednesday as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs came into effect today, including a 104% levy on Chinese imports.

Equities had initially rallied on hopes for progress in global tariff negotiations, but reversed course after Trump confirmed the tariffs would proceed as planned. The White House described the measures as \"non-negotiable,\" citing national security concerns. Meanwhile, China pledged to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the growing trade conflict. Despite reports that over 70 countries, including Japan and South Korea, expressed willingness to negotiate, the lack of concrete developments weighed on investor sentiment.

At the center of these pressures is President Trump\u2019s imminent decision to impose 104% tariffs on China starting Wednesday\u2014a stark signal of the administration's uncompromising trade policy that has deepened concerns over global economic growth. With persistent US-China friction, where Beijing vows to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against further tariff hikes, investors have recalibrated their expectations amid the potential recessionary impact of the escalating trade war. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves.

Earlier in the session, markets were buoyed by optimism over an eventual progress in tariff negotiations. Treasury Secretary Bessent noted that more than 70 countries had reached out to the White House, with several promising trade agreements potentially in the works. President Trump added to the hopeful tone, posting on Truth Social that he had a \u201cgreat call\u201d with South Korea\u2019s acting president and that China \u201calso wants to make a deal badly\u201d.

However, those concerns eased slightly after Trump signaled a willingness to engage in trade negotiations with key partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have contacted the White House seeking tariff discussions. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that the central bank would have to look at hard data before deciding on its next move.
