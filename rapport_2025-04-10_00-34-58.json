Gains were led by Nvidia (19.09%), Boeing (15.63%) and Apple (15.21%).\n - temps : 119 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Skyrocket as Trump Announces 90-Day Tariff Pause\n - description : US stocks soared on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of his new tariffs, causing a major market rally. The S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.5%, marking its biggest gain in five years, the Dow Jones rallied 2,960 points, or 7.9%, its biggest gain since 2020, while the Nasdaq jumped 12.1%, its largest one-day jump since 2001. The move extended the consistently-changing economic policy momentum by the administration, and would pause tariffs on key goods suppliers to the US that were initially hit with aggressive taxes like Vietnam and Cambodia. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Tech led the gains after taking the sharpest losses in the month's selloff up to now, with Nvidia soaring 18.7%, Tesla adding 22.7%, and Apple gaining 15.3%, marking its best day since 1998.\n - temps : 151 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Dollar Rebounds After Tariff Relief \n - description : The dollar index trimmed its losses to cross the 103 mark on Wednesday, rebounding from the six-month low of 102 touched on April 3rd after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the sweeping reciprocal tariff package last week for countries that have not retaliated. The move extended the momentum of uncertain economic policy in the US due to constantly changing measures, but triggered an aggressive flux of inflows into US equities as firms with foreign supply chains will not be hit as hard by levies. Still, the President raised tariffs on China to 125% after the latter retaliated against earlier tariffs, while Europe may be left out of the pause as it announced counter measures against the US. While the possibility of lesser tariffs than expected supported the dollar through the week, uncertain economic policy by the new administration kept recession concerns alive by a portion of the market.\n - temps : 236 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : FOMC Minutes Highlight Inflation Concerns Tied to Tariffs\n - description : Fed policymakers expected inflation to be pushed higher this year due to the impact of elevated tariffs, though they acknowledged considerable uncertainty around the magnitude and persistence of these effects, minutes from the last FOMC meeting in March 2025 showed. At the same time, a majority of officials highlighted the possibility that inflationary pressures from various sources could prove more persistent than previously anticipated. Nearly all participants viewed inflation risks as tilted to the upside, while risks to employment were seen as skewed to the downside. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during its March 2025 meeting, extending the pause in its rate-cut cycle that began in January, in line with expectations. The Fed also raised their expectations for inflation for 2025 and 2026 and downgraded their 2025 growth forecasts, while still anticipating reducing interest rates by around 50 bps this year, the same as in the December projection.\n - temps : 240 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Intuitive Surgical Hits 4-week High\n - description : Intuitive Surgical increased to a 4-week high of 520.92 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Intuitive Surgical gained 7.78%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 33.67%.\n - temps : 246 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Treasuries Sell-Off Eases\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note pulled back from its session high to trade around 4.4%, following President Trump\u2019s announcement of a 90-day suspension of higher reciprocal tariffs for dozens of trade partners, effective immediately. At the same time, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 125%, up from 104% previously. Meanwhile, the US Treasury auctioned $39 billion in 10-year notes, with demand seen as robust, offering some relief to the market. Earlier in the session, the benchmark yield had spiked as much as 20bps to 4.5%, reflecting growing investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. Concerns were further stoked by China\u2019s retaliatory move to impose an additional 50% tariff, as well as the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. Reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader shift to cash suggested that investors were liquidating positions, fueling fears that US Treasuries may be losing their traditional safe-haven status.\n - temps : 252 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Surge on Tariff Pause\n - description : US stocks surged on Wednesday, rebounding after testing over one-year lows earlier in the session after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the sweeping tariffs announced last week for the countries that did not retaliate. The S&P 500 surged nearly 8% and the Dow jumped 6.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 outperformed by rising up to 10% on the positive impact that risk-on sentiment has on tech stocks. The move extended the consistently-changing economic policy momentum by the administration, and would pause tariffs on key goods suppliers to the US that were initially hit with aggressive taxes like Vietnam and Cambodia. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Tech led the gains after taking the sharpest losses in the month's selloff up to now, with Nvidia soaring 15%, Tesla adding 16%, and Apple gaining 12%.\n - temps : 260 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Walmart Hits 4-week High\n - description : Walmart increased to a 4-week high of 90.16 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Walmart gained 2.55%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 50.26%.\n - temps : 273 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Treasury Sells Off\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note rose as much as 20bps to 4.5% on Wednesday before easing to 4.4% after a stronger-than-expected auction for 10-year notes offset lower demand by primary dealers earlier this month. Still, the ongoing selloff in bonds reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 325 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Hold Volatile Momentum\n - description : US stocks exchanged gains and blows on Wednesday, extending their volatile momentum and holding the selloff from recent sessions as aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 was volatile around under the 5,000 threshold, while the Dow and the Nasdaq held near over-one-year lows. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on $22 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns of forced liquidation to scramble for cash. Merck, Eli Lilly, and AbbVie fell between 3% and 5% after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceutical inputs. Tech advanced sharply following their underperformance this month.\n - temps : 402 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Crude Oil Inventories Rise More than Expected: EIA\n - description : Crude oil inventories in the US rose by 2.553 million barrels in the week ended April 4, 2025, above market expectations of a 2.2 million build, data from the EIA Petroleum Status Report showed.

Durable goods inventories edged up 0.2%, down from 0.8% the previous month, with slower growth in professional equipment (1.2% vs. 3.1%) and computer equipment (2.7% vs. 6.9%). Declines were noted in machinery (-0.5% vs. 0.5%), electrical equipment (-0.4% vs. 1.3%), and metals (-0.1% vs. 1.5%). Nondurable goods inventories rose 0.5%, also easing from 0.8% in January, with slower increases in drugs (0.3% vs. 0.9%), groceries (1.0% vs. 1.3%), and farm products (0.1% vs. 3.4%), alongside a decline in apparel (-0.3% vs. 0.6%).

Gains are led by Walmart (5.01%), Nvidia (4.02%) and Apple (3.16%). Biggest losers are Merck (-2.39%), J&J (-2.00%) and Amgen (-1.43%).\n - temps : 514 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Extend Choppy Trading\n - description : US stocks rose on Wednesday, momentarily halting the aggressive selloff from recent sessions even though aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from its major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 rebounded past 5,000 and the Dow added 100 points, while tech pushed the Nasdaq 100 to gain 1.5%. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on EUR 21 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns that investors are forced to liquidate equities to scramble for cash. Tech gained the most with Nvidia adding 3%. Drugmakers led the losses after Trump threatened to raise tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chemicals, with Merck and AbbVie sinking 3%.\n - temps : 529 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : NextEra Energy Hits 51-week Low\n - description : NextEra Energy decreased to a 51-week low of 63.11 USD.

Mounting concerns over global growth, including the risk of a US recession triggered by escalating trade tensions, dampened investor sentiment and fueled demand for other traditional safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. China announced it would impose an 84% tariff on US imports starting Thursday, well above the 34% rate initially signaled. The European Union also approved tariffs to hit around \u20ac21 billion ($23.2 billion) of US goods. The escalation comes in response to the latest round of US tariffs, which took effect today and include a 104% levy on Chinese goods. The dollar also came under pressure from a continued sell-off in US Treasuries, amid speculation that foreign investors are unwinding positions in response to rising uncertainty.\n - temps : 632 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Treasury Yields Rise Further \n - description : US 10-year yield rose as much as 20bps to a session high of 4.5% before settling around 4.39% on Wendesday. The 30-year yield also climbed, nearing 4.9%, its highest level in nearly 3 months. The bond sell-off reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. A 3-year note auction on Tuesday saw a weak demand. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 653 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Sink on Trade War Escalation\n - description : US equity futures rekindled their losses on Wednesday, extending the aggressive selloff from recent sessions after China raised their tariffs US goods to 84% in retaliation to the cumulative 104% recently imposed on China by the US. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow were over 1% lower, while those for the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.7%, all testing their lowest in over one year. China also added firms to export control lists, consolidating the full-out trade war between the world's two largest economies and limited hopes that both countries could strike a trade deal. The move contrasts sharply with those from Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, which have signaled attempts of discourse to lower barriers. Corporate giants were due to open sharply lower across all sectors. Delta sank after pulling its guidance due to recession concerns, while AbbVie fell after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceuticals. Walmart was 1% down after saying it is looking to cut costs after tariffs.\n - temps : 663 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : The Dow Jones Index Closes 0.84% Lower\n - description : In New York,  the Dow Jones Index decreased 320 points or 0.84 percent on Tuesday.

At the center of these pressures is President Trump\u2019s imminent decision to impose 104% tariffs on China starting Wednesday\u2014a stark signal of the administration's uncompromising trade policy that has deepened concerns over global economic growth. With persistent US-China friction, where Beijing vows to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against further tariff hikes, investors have recalibrated their expectations amid the potential recessionary impact of the escalating trade war. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves.

Earlier in the session, markets were buoyed by optimism over an eventual progress in tariff negotiations. Treasury Secretary Bessent noted that more than 70 countries had reached out to the White House, with several promising trade agreements potentially in the works. President Trump added to the hopeful tone, posting on Truth Social that he had a \u201cgreat call\u201d with South Korea\u2019s acting president and that China \u201calso wants to make a deal badly\u201d.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt characterized the tariffs as \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d emphasizing national security concerns, while China vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to previous retaliatory measures. Despite reports that over 70 countries, including Japan and South Korea, were eager to negotiate, the absence of concrete progress underscored persistent geopolitical tensions and deepened fears of an escalating trade war that could trigger a recession. Meanwhile, additional pressure from Canada\u2019s forthcoming retaliatory tariffs on U.S. vehicles further compounded investor unease.\n - temps : 1619 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre :  AbbVie Hits 9-week Low\n - description :  AbbVie decreased to a 9-week low of 176.30 USD.

Still, tensions between the US and China continued to escalate after Beijing vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to President Trump\u2019s threat of imposing new 50% tariffs unless China swiftly removed its retaliatory measures. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves.

However, those concerns eased slightly after Trump signaled a willingness to engage in trade negotiations with key partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have contacted the White House seeking tariff discussions. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that the central bank would have to look at hard data before deciding on its next move.

The new tariff policy affects over 180 countries, with a baseline 10% rate and steeper levies for key partners, of which China now faces a total 54% tariff. The move has raised the risk of a global trade war, with China retaliating by imposing 34% tariffs on US goods and the EU threatening countermeasures if talks fail. Trump dismissed market concerns, saying Sunday, \u201csometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\u201d In response, traders increased bets on Fed easing, with futures now pricing in five rate cuts for 2025. The CME FedWatch tool shows a roughly 50% chance of a quarter-point cut in May.\n - temps : 3434 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stock Futures Dive as Bear Market Looms Amid Escalating Trade War\n - description : U.S. stock futures plunged on Monday, extending the market selloff to a third consecutive session, as the White House pressed forward with aggressive tariffs on key trading partners despite the market turmoil.
