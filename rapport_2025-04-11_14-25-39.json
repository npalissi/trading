China announced it would raise tariffs on US goods to 125%, intensifying a tit-for-tat tariff war. The White House confirmed that the effective US tariff rate on Chinese imports now totals around 145%. Meanwhile, GDP data showed the economy grew by a more than expected 0.5% in February, marking the strongest monthly growth in nearly a year, with broad gains across all major sectors. The upside surprise, partly driven by pre-tariff manufacturing activity, led investors to scale back expectations for aggressive Bank of England rate cuts. Still, markets continue to price in at least three quarter-point cuts this year. Meanwhile, the BoE recently decided to switch from selling long-term bonds to short-term ones, reacting to recent market volatility, while continuing its overall debt reduction plans.\n - temps : 229 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Sterling Strengthens Toward 6-Month High\n - description : The British pound climbed past $1.30, moving closer to a six-month high of $1.31 on April 3, after UK GDP surprised to the upside with 0.5% growth in February\u2014five times the expected pace.

The solid data led traders to slightly reduce expectations for rapid Bank of England rate cuts, though three quarter-point cuts are still priced in for 2025. Sterling also benefited from a softer dollar, as investors react to the intensifying US-China trade war. China's finance ministry announced it will raise tariffs on US goods to 125%, following a week of retaliatory moves. The US now has a combined tariff burden on Chinese imports totaling 145%, including a 125% import duty and an additional 20% fentanyl-related levy.\n - temps : 245 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : UK Shares Pare Gains\n - description : The FTSE 100 reversed earlier gains to trade flat-to-lower on Friday after China\u2019s finance ministry announced it will raise tariffs on US goods to 125%, escalating the trade conflict. The US and China have been trading tit-for-tat tariff hikes all week, with the White House confirming that the cumulative US tariff burden on Chinese goods now reaches 145%\u2014including a 125% import duty and an additional 20% fentanyl-related levy.
