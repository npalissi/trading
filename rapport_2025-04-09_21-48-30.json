The move extended the momentum of uncertain economic policy in the US due to constantly changing measures, but triggered an aggressive flux of inflows into US equities as firms with foreign supply chains will not be hit as hard by levies. Still, the President raised tariffs on China to 125% after the latter retaliated against earlier tariffs, while Europe may be left out of the pause as it announced counter measures against the US. While the possibility of lesser tariffs than expected supported the dollar through the week, uncertain economic policy by the new administration kept recession concerns alive by a portion of the market.\n - temps : 69 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : FOMC Minutes Highlight Inflation Concerns Tied to Tariffs\n - description : Fed policymakers expected inflation to be pushed higher this year due to the impact of elevated tariffs, though they acknowledged considerable uncertainty around the magnitude and persistence of these effects, minutes from the last FOMC meeting in March 2025 showed. At the same time, a majority of officials highlighted the possibility that inflationary pressures from various sources could prove more persistent than previously anticipated. Nearly all participants viewed inflation risks as tilted to the upside, while risks to employment were seen as skewed to the downside. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during its March 2025 meeting, extending the pause in its rate-cut cycle that began in January, in line with expectations. The Fed also raised their expectations for inflation for 2025 and 2026 and downgraded their 2025 growth forecasts, while still anticipating reducing interest rates by around 50 bps this year, the same as in the December projection.\n - temps : 73 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Intuitive Surgical Hits 4-week High\n - description : Intuitive Surgical increased to a 4-week high of 520.92 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Intuitive Surgical gained 7.78%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 33.67%.\n - temps : 80 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Treasuries Sell-Off Eases\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note pulled back from its session high to trade around 4.4%, following President Trump\u2019s announcement of a 90-day suspension of higher reciprocal tariffs for dozens of trade partners, effective immediately. At the same time, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 125%, up from 104% previously. Meanwhile, the US Treasury auctioned $39 billion in 10-year notes, with demand seen as robust, offering some relief to the market. Earlier in the session, the benchmark yield had spiked as much as 20bps to 4.5%, reflecting growing investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. Concerns were further stoked by China\u2019s retaliatory move to impose an additional 50% tariff, as well as the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. Reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader shift to cash suggested that investors were liquidating positions, fueling fears that US Treasuries may be losing their traditional safe-haven status.\n - temps : 86 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Surge on Tariff Pause\n - description : US stocks surged on Wednesday, rebounding after testing over one-year lows earlier in the session after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the sweeping tariffs announced last week for the countries that did not retaliate. The S&P 500 surged nearly 8% and the Dow jumped 6.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 outperformed by rising up to 10% on the positive impact that risk-on sentiment has on tech stocks. The move extended the consistently-changing economic policy momentum by the administration, and would pause tariffs on key goods suppliers to the US that were initially hit with aggressive taxes like Vietnam and Cambodia. Still, Trump continued escalating the trade war with China by raising their tariffs to 125%, while measures on the EU are unlikely to be paused because of Brussels' retaliation announcement. Tech led the gains after taking the sharpest losses in the month's selloff up to now, with Nvidia soaring 15%, Tesla adding 16%, and Apple gaining 12%.\n - temps : 93 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Walmart Hits 4-week High\n - description : Walmart increased to a 4-week high of 90.16 USD. Over the past 4 weeks, Walmart gained 2.55%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 50.26%.\n - temps : 106 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Treasury Sells Off\n - description : The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note rose as much as 20bps to 4.5% on Wednesday before easing to 4.4% after a stronger-than-expected auction for 10-year notes offset lower demand by primary dealers earlier this month. Still, the ongoing selloff in bonds reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 158 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Hold Volatile Momentum\n - description : US stocks exchanged gains and blows on Wednesday, extending their volatile momentum and holding the selloff from recent sessions as aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 was volatile around under the 5,000 threshold, while the Dow and the Nasdaq held near over-one-year lows. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on $22 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns of forced liquidation to scramble for cash. Merck, Eli Lilly, and AbbVie fell between 3% and 5% after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceutical inputs. Tech advanced sharply following their underperformance this month.\n - temps : 236 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Crude Oil Inventories Rise More than Expected: EIA\n - description : Crude oil inventories in the US rose by 2.553 million barrels in the week ended April 4, 2025, above market expectations of a 2.2 million build, data from the EIA Petroleum Status Report showed.

On the other hand, gasoline stocks fell by 1.6 million, compared with forecasts of a 1.7 million draw.

Durable goods inventories edged up 0.2%, down from 0.8% the previous month, with slower growth in professional equipment (1.2% vs. 3.1%) and computer equipment (2.7% vs. 6.9%). Declines were noted in machinery (-0.5% vs. 0.5%), electrical equipment (-0.4% vs. 1.3%), and metals (-0.1% vs. 1.5%). Nondurable goods inventories rose 0.5%, also easing from 0.8% in January, with slower increases in drugs (0.3% vs. 0.9%), groceries (1.0% vs. 1.3%), and farm products (0.1% vs. 3.4%), alongside a decline in apparel (-0.3% vs. 0.6%). On an annual basis, wholesale inventories were up 1.1%.\n - temps : 334 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : The Dow Jones Index Opens 0.52% Higher\n - description : In New York,  the Dow Jones Index is picking up 195 points or 0.52 percent on Wednesday. Gains are led by Walmart (5.01%), Nvidia (4.02%) and Apple (3.16%). Biggest losers are Merck (-2.39%), J&J (-2.00%) and Amgen (-1.43%).\n - temps : 347 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Extend Choppy Trading\n - description : US stocks rose on Wednesday, momentarily halting the aggressive selloff from recent sessions even though aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from its major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 rebounded past 5,000 and the Dow added 100 points, while tech pushed the Nasdaq 100 to gain 1.5%. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on EUR 21 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns that investors are forced to liquidate equities to scramble for cash. Tech gained the most with Nvidia adding 3%. Drugmakers led the losses after Trump threatened to raise tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chemicals, with Merck and AbbVie sinking 3%.\n - temps : 363 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : NextEra Energy Hits 51-week Low\n - description : NextEra Energy decreased to a 51-week low of 63.11 USD.

Over the past 4 weeks, Johnson & Johnson lost 10.63%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 1.75%.\n - temps : 377 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Extends Losses, Approaches 6-Month Lows\n - description : The dollar index slipped further for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, falling to 102.2 and edging closer to the six-month lows touched last week. Mounting concerns over global growth, including the risk of a US recession triggered by escalating trade tensions, dampened investor sentiment and fueled demand for other traditional safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. China announced it would impose an 84% tariff on US imports starting Thursday, well above the 34% rate initially signaled. The European Union also approved tariffs to hit around \u20ac21 billion ($23.2 billion) of US goods. The escalation comes in response to the latest round of US tariffs, which took effect today and include a 104% levy on Chinese goods. The dollar also came under pressure from a continued sell-off in US Treasuries, amid speculation that foreign investors are unwinding positions in response to rising uncertainty.\n - temps : 465 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Treasury Yields Rise Further \n - description : US 10-year yield rose as much as 20bps to a session high of 4.5% before settling around 4.39% on Wendesday. The 30-year yield also climbed, nearing 4.9%, its highest level in nearly 3 months. The bond sell-off reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. A 3-year note auction on Tuesday saw a weak demand. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 487 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Sink on Trade War Escalation\n - description : US equity futures rekindled their losses on Wednesday, extending the aggressive selloff from recent sessions after China raised their tariffs US goods to 84% in retaliation to the cumulative 104% recently imposed on China by the US. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow were over 1% lower, while those for the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.7%, all testing their lowest in over one year. China also added firms to export control lists, consolidating the full-out trade war between the world's two largest economies and limited hopes that both countries could strike a trade deal. The move contrasts sharply with those from Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, which have signaled attempts of discourse to lower barriers. Corporate giants were due to open sharply lower across all sectors. Delta sank after pulling its guidance due to recession concerns, while AbbVie fell after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceuticals. Walmart was 1% down after saying it is looking to cut costs after tariffs.\n - temps : 497 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Mortgage Applications Rise by 20%\n - description : Mortgage application volumes in the US surged by 20% from the previous week in the first week of April, more than erasing the three consecutive declines from the previous periods, according to data compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The surge was in line with the 9bps drop in benchmark mortgage rates, tracking the drop in long-dated Treasuries and MBS as signs of a trade war between the US and major trading partners triggered a flight to fixed income in the period. Applications for a contract to refinance a mortgage, which are more sensitive to short-term changes in interest rates, surged by 35%. In turn, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose by 9%.\n - temps : 513 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Mortgage Rates Fall to October-Lows: MBA\n - description : The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) in the US fell to 6.61% in the week ended April 4th 2025, the lowest since mid-October, from 6.7% in the previous period, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. It compares with a rate of 7.01% a year earlier. Meanwhile, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo loan balances (greater than $806,500) decreased to 6.65% from 6.76% and the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the FHA decreased to 6.33% from 6.37%.\n - temps : 523 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Yield Rebounds Further\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield surged above 4.24% as escalating trade tensions forced investors to demand higher returns amid mounting uncertainty. At the center of these pressures is President Trump\u2019s imminent decision to impose 104% tariffs on China starting Wednesday\u2014a stark signal of the administration's uncompromising trade policy that has deepened concerns over global economic growth. With persistent US-China friction, where Beijing vows to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against further tariff hikes, investors have recalibrated their expectations amid the potential recessionary impact of the escalating trade war. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves. Investors are now turning their attention to this week\u2019s inflation data, which could significantly influence expectations for potential rate cuts in the coming months.\n - temps : 1436 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Berkshire Hathaway Hits 6-week Low\n - description : Berkshire Hathaway decreased to a 6-week low of 486.90 USD.

The decline followed comments from a White House official confirming that the US will move forward with tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports, set to take effect at midnight. Earlier in the session, markets were buoyed by optimism over an eventual progress in tariff negotiations. Treasury Secretary Bessent noted that more than 70 countries had reached out to the White House, with several promising trade agreements potentially in the works. President Trump added to the hopeful tone, posting on Truth Social that he had a \u201cgreat call\u201d with South Korea\u2019s acting president and that China \u201calso wants to make a deal badly\u201d.

The S&P 500 fell 1.7%, the Dow lost 320 points, and the Nasdaq dropped 1.8%, as the market reacted to the administration\u2019s uncompromising stance. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt characterized the tariffs as \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d emphasizing national security concerns, while China vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to previous retaliatory measures. Despite reports that over 70 countries, including Japan and South Korea, were eager to negotiate, the absence of concrete progress underscored persistent geopolitical tensions and deepened fears of an escalating trade war that could trigger a recession. Meanwhile, additional pressure from Canada\u2019s forthcoming retaliatory tariffs on U.S. vehicles further compounded investor unease.\n - temps : 1453 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre :  AbbVie Hits 9-week Low\n - description :  AbbVie decreased to a 9-week low of 176.30 USD. Over the past 4 weeks,  AbbVie lost 18.56%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 3.71%.\n - temps : 1467 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Lose Momentum\n - description : U.S. stocks lost momentum Tuesday afternoon after a strong early rally, as optimism over global tariff negotiations gave way to renewed uncertainty around trade policy. White House Press Secretary Leavitt reaffirmed the administration\u2019s uncompromising stance, calling the sweeping tariffs \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d and citing national security concerns. The S&P 500 trimmed gains to hover above the flatline, the Dow Jones remained up just over 200 points, and the Nasdaq added roughly 0.3%. Earlier gains had been driven by reports that more than 70 countries, including Japan and South Korea, expressed interest in talks. However, the lack of tangible progress and China\u2019s continued defiance\u2014vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d\u2014kept geopolitical tensions front and center, prompting investors to recalibrated expectations for a swift de-escalation. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group surged 7.7% after the U.S. government announced higher-than-expected reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans.\n - temps : 1554 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : The Dow Jones Index Opens 3.66% Higher\n - description : In New York,  the Dow Jones Index is up by 1390 points or 3.66 percent on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 surged 3.5%, the Dow Jones soared by 1,300 points (3.5%), and the Nasdaq rose 4%. The rebound followed comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who disclosed that roughly 70 countries, including Japan, have reached out to the White House to initiate tariff talks. Despite the market optimism, U.S.-China tensions remained elevated. Beijing reiterated its resolve to \"fight to the end\" after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs unless China swiftly removed its retaliatory measures. Trump also stated he is waiting for a call from Chinese officials to kick off trade negotiations. Among individual stocks, UnitedHealth Group surged 7.7% after the U.S. government announced higher-than-expected reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage health plans.\n - temps : 1813 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10Y Bond Yield Rises Above 4.2%\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.2%, rebounding further from six-month low reached on Friday as investors turned again to risky assets on hopes for progress in US tariff negotiations. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that over 70 countries, including Japan, had reached out to the White House to initiate talks about tariffs. Still, tensions between the US and China continued to escalate after Beijing vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to President Trump\u2019s threat of imposing new 50% tariffs unless China swiftly removed its retaliatory measures. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves. Investors are now turning their attention to this week\u2019s inflation data, which could significantly influence expectations for potential rate cuts in the coming months.\n - temps : 1855 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stock Futures Jump on Tariff Talk Hopes\n - description : US stock futures surged on Tuesday following three days of sharp losses and heightened volatility, fueled by optimism over potential progress in US tariff negotiations. Futures linked to the S&P 500 jumped 2.7%, the Dow Jones was poised for a 1,120-point gain, or 3%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 2.4%. This rally came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that around 70 countries had approached the White House to initiate talks on tariffs. Bessent, along with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, is set to meet with Japanese officials, who are pushing to remove the 24% tariff on Japan. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and China remained high after Beijing vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to President Trump\u2019s threat of new 50% tariffs unless its retaliatory measures were quickly lifted. Looking ahead, investors are focused on upcoming inflation data, which could impact expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates.\n - temps : 1864 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Small Business Sentiment Weaker than Expected\n - description : The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index fell 3.3 points to 97.4 in March 2025, its lowest level since October 2024 and well below the market expectation of 101.3.

Yields had recently come under pressure as escalating trade tensions\u2014driven by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff stance\u2014sparked recession fears and drove a flight to safe-haven assets. However, those concerns eased slightly after Trump signaled a willingness to engage in trade negotiations with key partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have contacted the White House seeking tariff discussions. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that the central bank would have to look at hard data before deciding on its next move. Investors are now focused on this week\u2019s inflation data, which could prove pivotal in shaping expectations for potential rate cuts in the months ahead.\n - temps : 2245 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Swings as Trade Tensions Cloud Outlook\n - description : The US dollar index swung around 103 on Tuesday, trimming recent gains as persistent trade uncertainties weighed on the broader economic and inflation outlook. President Donald Trump denied rumors of a potential pause in his sweeping tariff measures but expressed a willingness to enter negotiations with trade partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have reached out to the White House seeking tariff talks. However, tensions escalated as Trump threatened China with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing fails to remove its levies on US imports. In response, China condemned the threats as \"blackmail\" and vowed to \"fight to the end\" to defend its interests, fueling concerns of a deepening trade conflict. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the need for hard data before deciding on the next move. All eyes now turn to this week\u2019s inflation data, which could be pivotal in shaping expectations for future rate cuts.\n - temps : 2502 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Rise as Traders Weigh Tariff Developments\n - description : US stock futures rose on Tuesday as market volatility remained high, while investors navigated tariff-driven uncertainties. On Monday, the Dow and S&P 500 fell for a third consecutive session, losing 0.91% and 0.23%, respectively. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1% as investors scooped up beaten down shares of key technology names such as Nvidia (3.5%), Amazon (2.5%), Meta (2.3%), Palantir (5.2%), and Broacom (5.4%). All three major indexes initially surged early in the session on speculation of a 90-day tariff pause, a rumor that was swiftly denied by the White House. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that nearly 70 countries, including Japan, have reached out to the administration to discuss tariff negotiations. Looking ahead, investor focus shifts to key inflation data due later this week, which could influence expectations around the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on monetary policy.\n - temps : 2650 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : The Dow Jones Index Closes 0.91% Lower\n - description : In New York,  the Dow Jones Index fell 349 points or 0.91 percent on Monday. Leading the losses are Travelers Companies (-3.78%), Apple (-3.60%) and Home Depot (-3.56%). Top gainers were Nvidia (3.02%), Amazon (2.36%) and JPMorgan (1.90%).\n - temps : 2832 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dow Tumbles For 3rd Day\n - description : US stocks closed mostly lower on Monday, as markets reacted to President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, including a threat to impose an additional 50% tariff if Beijing did not back down from its retaliatory measures. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, the Dow Jones  dropped 342 points in a wild session marked by record intraday swings, the Nasdaq 100 closed up 0.2% after earlier plunging over 3%. Volatility spiked across asset classes, with equities, Treasuries, and commodities all whipsawed by conflicting headlines, including speculation of a 90-day tariff pause, a rumor the White House quickly denied. Domestic automakers were under pressure as concerns grew over upcoming tariffs on auto parts, with General Motors (-1.4%), Stellantis (-7.8%), Ford (-3.6%), and Tesla (-2.5%) all posting losses. Apple\u2019s (-3.7%) market cap has dropped $640 billion in three days, with shares down 20% due to its significant reliance on China, where tariffs have reached 54%.\n - temps : 2864 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Consumer Credit Unexpectedly Falls\n - description : Total US consumer credit declined by $0.81 billion in February 2025, marking the first drop since November. This followed a downwardly revised increase of $8.9 billion in January and came in well below market expectations of a $15.2 billion rise. The decline translated to a 0.2% decrease in consumer credit on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, reflecting a sharp pullback in credit card balances and a drop in motor vehicle and other nonrevolving loans. Revolving credit, which includes credit card debt, edged up by $128 million and rose at an annual rate of 0.1%. In contrast, nonrevolving credit\u2014such as loans for vehicle purchases and education\u2014fell by $938 million, the first decline in nearly a year, and decreased at an annual rate of 0.3%.\n - temps : 2912 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Treasury Yield Rises Sharply\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield jumped nearly 20 basis points to around 4.2% on Monday, rebounding from 6-month low as growing recession fears in US may prompt investors to question the safety of US Treasuries as a haven asset. The US tariffs have fueled concerns about a potential global trade war, as other countries respond with retaliatory measures against the U.S. On Friday, China hit back with 34% tariffs on American goods, while the European Union has pledged to introduce countermeasures if talks break down.

Fed funds futures now suggest roughly a 50% probability of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's May meeting and are pricing in at least five rate cuts over the course of 2025.\n - temps : 3127 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Tesla Hits 23-week Low\n - description : Tesla decreased to a 23-week low of 217.87 USD.
