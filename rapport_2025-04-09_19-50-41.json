Still, the ongoing selloff in bonds reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 40 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stocks Hold Volatile Momentum\n - description : US stocks exchanged gains and blows on Wednesday, extending their volatile momentum and holding the selloff from recent sessions as aggressive tariffs by the US and mounting retaliation from major trading partners backed concerns of an incoming recession. The S&P 500 was volatile around under the 5,000 threshold, while the Dow and the Nasdaq held near over-one-year lows. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on $22 billion of goods. The moves backed warnings an incoming recession amid skepticism that President Trump will be open for bilateral deals with foreign delegations. Stocks were also pressured by the bond selloff and concerns of forced liquidation to scramble for cash. Merck, Eli Lilly, and AbbVie fell between 3% and 5% after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceutical inputs. Tech advanced sharply following their underperformance this month.\n - temps : 118 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Crude Oil Inventories Rise More than Expected: EIA\n - description : Crude oil inventories in the US rose by 2.553 million barrels in the week ended April 4, 2025, above market expectations of a 2.2 million build, data from the EIA Petroleum Status Report showed.

The S&P 500 rebounded past 5,000 and the Dow added 100 points, while tech pushed the Nasdaq 100 to gain 1.5%. China raised its tariffs against the US to 84% and added companies to its no-export list after the US's tariff increase to a cumulative 104%, while the EU confirmed tariffs on EUR 21 billion of goods.

Mounting concerns over global growth, including the risk of a US recession triggered by escalating trade tensions, dampened investor sentiment and fueled demand for other traditional safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. China announced it would impose an 84% tariff on US imports starting Thursday, well above the 34% rate initially signaled. The European Union also approved tariffs to hit around \u20ac21 billion ($23.2 billion) of US goods. The escalation comes in response to the latest round of US tariffs, which took effect today and include a 104% levy on Chinese goods. The dollar also came under pressure from a continued sell-off in US Treasuries, amid speculation that foreign investors are unwinding positions in response to rising uncertainty.\n - temps : 347 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Treasury Yields Rise Further \n - description : US 10-year yield rose as much as 20bps to a session high of 4.5% before settling around 4.39% on Wendesday. The 30-year yield also climbed, nearing 4.9%, its highest level in nearly 3 months. The bond sell-off reflected mounting investor anxiety following Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, a concern intensified by China\u2019s latest move to impose an additional 50% retaliatory tariff and the EU\u2019s approval of tariffs targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. There were reports of foreign selling and signs of a broader flight to cash, as some investors appeared to be liquidating positions - adding to concerns that US bonds may be losing their traditional safe-haven appeal. A 3-year note auction on Tuesday saw a weak demand. Japan, China, and the UK, the biggest holders of US Treasuries and likely auction participants\u2014are also among the nations hit hardest by US tariffs. The tariff escalation has fueled recession fears and inflation concerns, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to ease policy.\n - temps : 369 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Sink on Trade War Escalation\n - description : US equity futures rekindled their losses on Wednesday, extending the aggressive selloff from recent sessions after China raised their tariffs US goods to 84% in retaliation to the cumulative 104% recently imposed on China by the US. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow were over 1% lower, while those for the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.7%, all testing their lowest in over one year. China also added firms to export control lists, consolidating the full-out trade war between the world's two largest economies and limited hopes that both countries could strike a trade deal. The move contrasts sharply with those from Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, which have signaled attempts of discourse to lower barriers. Corporate giants were due to open sharply lower across all sectors. Delta sank after pulling its guidance due to recession concerns, while AbbVie fell after Trump threatened to tariff pharmaceuticals. Walmart was 1% down after saying it is looking to cut costs after tariffs.\n - temps : 379 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Mortgage Applications Rise by 20%\n - description : Mortgage application volumes in the US surged by 20% from the previous week in the first week of April, more than erasing the three consecutive declines from the previous periods, according to data compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The surge was in line with the 9bps drop in benchmark mortgage rates, tracking the drop in long-dated Treasuries and MBS as signs of a trade war between the US and major trading partners triggered a flight to fixed income in the period. Applications for a contract to refinance a mortgage, which are more sensitive to short-term changes in interest rates, surged by 35%. In turn, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose by 9%.\n - temps : 395 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Mortgage Rates Fall to October-Lows: MBA\n - description : The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) in the US fell to 6.61% in the week ended April 4th 2025, the lowest since mid-October, from 6.7% in the previous period, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. It compares with a rate of 7.01% a year earlier.

Mounting concerns over global growth, including the risk of a US recession triggered by escalating trade tensions, dampened investor sentiment and fueled demand for traditional safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The dollar also came under pressure from a continued sell-off in US Treasuries, amid speculation that foreign investors are unwinding positions in response to rising uncertainty. The latest wave of reciprocal US tariffs, including a 104% levy on Chinese imports, officially took effect on Wednesday, adding to fears of broader economic fallout.\n - temps : 490 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Treasury Yields Rise \n - description : US Treasury yields climbed on Wednesday as markets continued to digest the implications of President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff measures on growth and inflation. The 10-year yield briefly touched 4.5% before easing to around 4.35%, while the 30-year yield rose above 4.8%, its highest level in roughly two months. The move reflected heightened investor anxiety following the implementation of Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, which include a cumulative 104% levy on Chinese imports. The tariff escalation has fueled concerns over a potential US recession and stubborn inflation, which could limit the Fed\u2019s ability to lower interest rates further. Adding to pressure on Treasuries were reports of foreign selling and a broader flight to liquidity, as some investors appeared to be raising cash. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department auctioned $58 billion in 3-year notes in what was a considered a \u201cweak\u201d auction, the first coupon issuance since the tariff announcement.\n - temps : 523 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Yield Rallies to 6-Week High\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield surged to around 4.4% on Wednesday, hitting its highest levels in six weeks as investors continued to assess the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies on growth and inflation.

The increase follows China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs, matching Trump\u2019s initial 34% hike. In response, Trump vowed an additional 50% duty. Including earlier levies from February and March, the total tariff hike on Chinese goods during Trump\u2019s second term reaches 104%. These moves come despite sharp declines in major U.S. indexes and warnings from economists, who caution that the tariffs could drive inflation and disrupt global supply chains. Trump remains defiant, claiming the policy will restore America\u2019s manufacturing base by encouraging companies to return. However, many experts question the feasibility and timeline of such a shift. Beijing has condemned the escalating trade conflict, accusing the U.S. of blackmail and vowing to \u201cfight it to the end.\u201d\n - temps : 924 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Weakens as Trump Tariffs Take Effect\n - description : The dollar index depreciated past 102.5 on Wednesday, sliding for the second straight session as the implementation of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs weighed on the currency. China faces a cumulative 104% levy amid a full blown trade war with the US, with Beijing vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d to protect its interests. Traders were also disappointed by the lack of concrete developments in trade negotiations even though President Trump spoke with various leaders from major trading partners. Markets are worried that an escalating global trade war could push the US economy into a recession and force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The currency weakened across the board, with the most pronounced selling activity seen against the euro, Australian dollar, and Chinese yuan.\n - temps : 954 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre :  AbbVie Hits 9-week Low\n - description :  AbbVie decreased to a 9-week low of 176.30 USD.

White House Press Secretary Leavitt reaffirmed the administration\u2019s uncompromising stance, calling the sweeping tariffs \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d and citing national security concerns. The S&P 500 trimmed gains to hover above the flatline, the Dow Jones remained up just over 200 points, and the Nasdaq added roughly 0.3%. Earlier gains had been driven by reports that more than 70 countries, including Japan and South Korea, expressed interest in talks. However, the lack of tangible progress and China\u2019s continued defiance\u2014vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d\u2014kept geopolitical tensions front and center, prompting investors to recalibrated expectations for a swift de-escalation.

The rebound followed comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who disclosed that roughly 70 countries, including Japan, have reached out to the White House to initiate tariff talks. Despite the market optimism, U.S.-China tensions remained elevated. Beijing reiterated its resolve to \"fight to the end\" after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs unless China swiftly removed its retaliatory measures. Trump also stated he is waiting for a call from Chinese officials to kick off trade negotiations. Among individual stocks, UnitedHealth Group surged 7.7% after the U.S. government announced higher-than-expected reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage health plans.\n - temps : 1695 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10Y Bond Yield Rises Above 4.2%\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.2%, rebounding further from six-month low reached on Friday as investors turned again to risky assets on hopes for progress in US tariff negotiations. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that over 70 countries, including Japan, had reached out to the White House to initiate talks about tariffs. Still, tensions between the US and China continued to escalate after Beijing vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to President Trump\u2019s threat of imposing new 50% tariffs unless China swiftly removed its retaliatory measures. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized that the central bank would need to carefully assess economic data before making any decisions on future policy moves. Investors are now turning their attention to this week\u2019s inflation data, which could significantly influence expectations for potential rate cuts in the coming months.\n - temps : 1737 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Stock Futures Jump on Tariff Talk Hopes\n - description : US stock futures surged on Tuesday following three days of sharp losses and heightened volatility, fueled by optimism over potential progress in US tariff negotiations. Futures linked to the S&P 500 jumped 2.7%, the Dow Jones was poised for a 1,120-point gain, or 3%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 2.4%. This rally came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that around 70 countries had approached the White House to initiate talks on tariffs. Bessent, along with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, is set to meet with Japanese officials, who are pushing to remove the 24% tariff on Japan. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and China remained high after Beijing vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in response to President Trump\u2019s threat of new 50% tariffs unless its retaliatory measures were quickly lifted.

Yields had recently come under pressure as escalating trade tensions\u2014driven by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff stance\u2014sparked recession fears and drove a flight to safe-haven assets. However, those concerns eased slightly after Trump signaled a willingness to engage in trade negotiations with key partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have contacted the White House seeking tariff discussions. On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that the central bank would have to look at hard data before deciding on its next move. Investors are now focused on this week\u2019s inflation data, which could prove pivotal in shaping expectations for potential rate cuts in the months ahead.\n - temps : 2127 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : Dollar Swings as Trade Tensions Cloud Outlook\n - description : The US dollar index swung around 103 on Tuesday, trimming recent gains as persistent trade uncertainties weighed on the broader economic and inflation outlook. President Donald Trump denied rumors of a potential pause in his sweeping tariff measures but expressed a willingness to enter negotiations with trade partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have reached out to the White House seeking tariff talks. However, tensions escalated as Trump threatened China with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing fails to remove its levies on US imports.

On the monetary policy front, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the need for hard data before deciding on the next move. All eyes now turn to this week\u2019s inflation data, which could be pivotal in shaping expectations for future rate cuts.\n - temps : 2384 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Futures Rise as Traders Weigh Tariff Developments\n - description : US stock futures rose on Tuesday as market volatility remained high, while investors navigated tariff-driven uncertainties.

All three major indexes initially surged early in the session on speculation of a 90-day tariff pause, a rumor that was swiftly denied by the White House. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that nearly 70 countries, including Japan, have reached out to the administration to discuss tariff negotiations.

Domestic automakers were under pressure as concerns grew over upcoming tariffs on auto parts, with General Motors (-1.4%), Stellantis (-7.8%), Ford (-3.6%), and Tesla (-2.5%) all posting losses. Apple\u2019s (-3.7%) market cap has dropped $640 billion in three days, with shares down 20% due to its significant reliance on China, where tariffs have reached 54%.\n - temps : 2746 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US Consumer Credit Unexpectedly Falls\n - description : Total US consumer credit declined by $0.81 billion in February 2025, marking the first drop since November.

The decline translated to a 0.2% decrease in consumer credit on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, reflecting a sharp pullback in credit card balances and a drop in motor vehicle and other nonrevolving loans. Revolving credit, which includes credit card debt, edged up by $128 million and rose at an annual rate of 0.1%. In contrast, nonrevolving credit\u2014such as loans for vehicle purchases and education\u2014fell by $938 million, the first decline in nearly a year, and decreased at an annual rate of 0.3%.\n - temps : 2794 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : US 10-Year Treasury Yield Rises Sharply\n - description : The US 10-year Treasury yield jumped nearly 20 basis points to around 4.2% on Monday, rebounding from 6-month low as growing recession fears in US may prompt investors to question the safety of US Treasuries as a haven asset.

The rise in the yield comes despite traders increasing their bets on rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, driven by expectations of a weakening economy. Fed funds futures now suggest roughly a 50% probability of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's May meeting and are pricing in at least five rate cuts over the course of 2025.\n - temps : 3010 mins\n------------------------------------\n - titre : P&G Hits 11-week Low\n - description : P&G decreased to a 11-week low of 159.22 USD.
